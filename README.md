### Number-Guessing-Game:
 This is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 0 and 100 in a maximum of 10 attempts.
 The game will end after 10 attempts and if the player failed to guess the number, and then he loses the game.
 If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output "Too high, try again!"
 Otherwise, If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output "Too low, try again!"
 Finally, if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets an output: "Congratulations, you won!".
